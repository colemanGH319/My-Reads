# MyReads Project

This is the final project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The project utilizes a combination of class-based components, stateless functional components, controlled components and state management to create an interactive application that allows the user to search for books, add them to a reading list and move them between "Want to Read", "Currently Reading" and "Read" shelves.

## TL;DR

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
